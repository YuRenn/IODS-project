I just solved the problem of uploading Rstudio to Github before writing chapter 1, thanks to the help of my classmate, I'm very happy to have solved this trouble!

I'm really looking forward to this course, after having studied QSR I'm really looking forward to continuing my in-depth study of R and analytics, and I also really like Kimmo's course, so I've chosen this course.

The R for Health Data Science book was something I had already come across in the QSR and the second time through I was able to get to grips with some of the necessary commands in R. The parts that were difficult to understand before were now understandable and this was a very necessary process.
